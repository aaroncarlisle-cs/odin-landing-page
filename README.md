# odin-landing-page
This is the final project in The Odin Project's course on full-stack development for the CSS foundations section. The web page 
is created from scratch based on two images provided by Odin. The images are contained in the img folder. The file directory 
is structured similarly to how I was taught in college.

All additional images will be used with permission and attributed below.
